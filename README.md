# PythonBRMLtoolbox

## What is PythonBRMLtoolbox?
[BRMLtoolbox](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Software)
 in Python 3.7. My goal with this repository is to:
 1. Learn BRMLtoolbox with an insider perspective
 2. Provide a Python package for BRMLtoolbox which is available
    in MATLAB, Python 2.7 and Julia.
 3. Improve my Python skills
 
 ## What is BRMLtoolbox?
 The BRMLtoolbox is a MATLAB toolbox written by David Barber, Reader for the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning MSc at UCL. The toolbox should be used together with the book Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning. It is a set of tools to help readers see how mathematical models translate into actual code.
 
 ## Software Requirements
 1. Python (3.6 onwards, although only type hints would need to be removed for Python 3.5)
 2. Numpy
 
 ## Mathematical Requirements
 1. Calculus & Linear Algebra
 2. Probability
 3. Algorithms
 4. Statistics (Bayesian mainly)
 I am currenlty trying to write an introduction to Probability here in [my Proofwiki account](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/User:MauroCamaraEscudero), although it is just a draft for now.
 
 ## Contributions
 Please feel free to contribute to this project! There are already a few incomplete implementations of the code, hopefully this version will be more up-to-date and efficient with your help!
 
 ## Reference & Book
 As I said earlier BRMLtoolbox comes with [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf) book.
